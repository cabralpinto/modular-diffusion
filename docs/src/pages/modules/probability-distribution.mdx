# {frontmatter.title}

In Diffusion Models, the choice of a probability distribution plays a pivotal role in modeling the noise that guides transitions between time steps. While the `Distribution` type is not directly used to parametrize the `Model` class, it is used to create custom `Noise` and `Loss` modules. Modular Diffusion provides you with a set of distribution classes you can use to create your own modules.

> Parameter shapes

> Distribution parameters are represented as tensors with the same size as a batch. This essentially means that a `Distribution` object functions as a collection of distributions, where each individual element in a batch corresponds to a unique distribution. For instance, in the case of a standard DDPM, each pixel in a batch of images is associated with its own `mu` and `sigma` values.

## Normal distribution

Continuous probability distribution that is ubiquitously used in Diffusion Models. It has the following density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

Sampling from a normal distribution is denoted $$x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$ and is equivalent to sampling from a standard normal distribution ($\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$) and scaling the result by $\sigma$ and shifting it by $\mu$:

- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \text{I})$
- $x = \mu + \sigma \epsilon$

### Parameters

- `mu: Tensor` -> Mean tensor $\mu$.
- `sigma: Tensor` -> Standard deviation tensor $\sigma$. Must have the same shape as `mu`.

> Parametrization
>
> Please note that the `sigma` parameter does not correspond to the variance $\sigma^2$, but the standard deviation $\sigma$.

### Example

```python
import torch
from diffusion.distribution import Normal as N

distribution = N(torch.zeros(3), torch.full((3,), 2))
x, epsilon = distribution.sample()
# x = tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000])
# epsilon = tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000])
```

## Categorical distribution

Discrete probability distribution that separately specifies the probability of each one of $k$ possible categories in a vector $p$. Sampling from a normal distribution is denoted $x \sim \text{Cat}(p)$.

### Parameters

- `p: Tensor` -> Probability tensor $p$. All elements must be non-negative and sum to 1 in the last dimension.

### Example

```python
import torch
from diffusion.distribution import Categorical as Cat

distribution = Cat(torch.tensor([[.1, .3, .6], [0, 0, 1]]))
x, _ = distribution.sample()
# x = tensor([1, 2])
```

> Noise tensor

> The categorical distribution returns `None` in place of a noise tensor $\epsilon$, as it would have no meaningful interpretation. Therefore, you must ignore the second return value when sampling.
